Quick Start: 
  All code was written the original knn.ipynb provided my professor Rui Wu. 
  The only external dependency is sklearn. 
   It may be necessary to run the cell containing the pip install sklearn command. 
   All necessary code is in the Main Cell at the bottom of the notebook. 

Best K?
  Most of the K's return an accuracy of 90-100 consistently. The range of K's that most often return the best accuracy are within the range of 8-12    returning around 95-97% accuracy with few outliers. This is most likely because in the amount of data present this is the amount that gives enough context to accurately perform a classification without overfitting the data.
